# Indexing


I will refer to indexing as the act of subsetting, accessing, or modifying elements, components, or parts of an object. Indexing is critical for manipulating or accessing parts of objects.

## Exercises

1. Let 
    ```{r}
    x <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4)
    y <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4)
    ```
    Using indexes, cross-multiply the second row of `x` and the third column of `y`. What is the sum of the resulting vector?

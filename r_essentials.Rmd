# Introduction {#r-essentials-intro}

This section is a curation of resources for learning R. Readings are primarily sourced from the following texts:

* [*An Introduction to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) by Venables, Smith, and the R Core Team. Abbreviated as "intro-r". PDF download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf).
* [*R Language Definition*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html) by the R Core Team. Abbreviated as "rldef". PDF download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf).
* [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham. Abbreviated as "adv-r".
* [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham. Abbreviated as "r4ds".

In each R essentials chapter, including this chapter, there is a list of *readings*. Following the list of readings is a *focus* section that outlines important concepts to be gained from the readings. At the end of each chapter, exercises are (usually) provided. 


## Readings

Primary readings

Secondary readings

* [adv-r - 3 - Names and values](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html)
* [Vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html) from *Advanced R - 1st Edition*

## Focus

The primary readings should be read and the secondary readings are only encouraged. The primary readings are to help you learn how to use R and RStudio at their most basic level. Style guides are provided so as to learn how to write code in a readable manner. The secondary readings are provided as exposure; they contain concepts that may not be understandable if you have not used R extensively. The secondary readings should be revisited occasionally as your R knowledge base grows.

## Exercises

None.
